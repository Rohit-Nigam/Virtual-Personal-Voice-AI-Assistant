Hello Rohit Kumar,

I am glad to assist you with generating a model for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are a type of deep learning model that are commonly used for image classification and recognition tasks. Here's a general outline of how you can create a CNN model:

1. Import necessary libraries:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
```
2. Define the model architecture:
```python
model = Sequential()

# Convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)))

# Max pooling layer
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))

# Flattening layer
model.add(Flatten())

# Dense layer
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))

# Output layer
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```
In the above architecture, we have added a convolutional layer with 32 filters of size 3x3. We have used the 'relu' activation function, which is commonly used for CNNs. The input shape is set to (64, 64, 3) as we are working with RGB images of size 64x64.

Next, we have added a max pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2. This will help in reducing the spatial dimensions of the input volume.

We then flatten the output of the max pooling layer and add a dense layer of 128 neurons with 'relu' activation.

Finally, we add an output layer with 10 neurons and 'softmax' activation. This is because we are working on a multi-class classification problem.

3. Compile the model:
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```
Here, we have used the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, which are commonly used for multi-class classification problems.

4. Train the model:
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
```
Here, X\_train and y\_train are the training data and labels, X\_val and y\_val are the validation data and labels. We have set the number of epochs to 10.

5. Evaluate the model:
```python
model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
```
Here, X\_test and y\_test are the test data and labels.

This is a basic outline of how you can create a CNN model. You can modify the architecture and hyperparameters based on your specific problem.
