Hello Rohit, I'm happy to help you with your content writing needs! As you've requested, I'll write a poem for you. Here it is:

In the quiet of the night,
Underneath the twinkling light,
Lies a world of dreams and hope,
A world where anything is possible.

The stars shine bright up above,
In the sky they dance and weave,
Telling tales of love and loss,
Of victory and defeat, of life's great cost.

The moon shines down so softly,
Whispering secrets of the night,
Guiding the way for those who roam,
In the darkness, it helps them find their home.

The wind whispers through the trees,
Carrying with it memories and stories,
Of the past and the present,
Of all that's happened, and all that's yet to come.

The night is a time of peace and calm,
A time for dreams and for the soul,
A time to rest and rejuvenate,
And prepare for the day that's about to unfold.

So close your eyes and let yourself drift,
Into the world of dreams and fantasy,
For in the quiet of the night,
Anything is possible, and you can be free.
